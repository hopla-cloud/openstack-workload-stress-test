# openstack-workload-stress-test

[![standard-readme compliant](https://img.shields.io/badge/readme%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme)

Ansible roles made for stress testing an OpenStack Instrastructure with precise workloads : CPU/RAM, disks and Network.

## Getting Started

As a public cloud provider, we needed a simple and efficient tool to make stress tests on precise and "real life" work loads.
This is, for the moment, a work in progress project. Only tested with Red Hat OpenStack 13 (Queens).

### Prerequisites

- Ansible 2.7+ Machine, able to connect to you OpenStack public APIs
- OpenStack Queens Infrastructure

### Installing (Not documented yet)

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests (Not documented yet)

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests (Not documented yet)

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment (Not documented yet)

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
